    <p>Three days before the New Year's, I had an idea to build a simple printable calendar app.</p>

    <p>This idea had no more chances of getting shipped than any before it. There are people who ship projects and there's me &mdash; at best, able to ship client work on a deadline.</p>

    <p>If I were to build this app, it had to be out by Jan 1st, I thought. By Jan 2nd, half of us will have already broken their New Year resolutions and won't be bothered.</p>

    <h2>Dec 31st</h2>
    
    <p>Dec 31st rolled around and it was getting obvious that it wasn't going to happen. A year from now I'd get that renewal email from Namecheap reminding me that I never built <a href="https://habitcalendar.co/" target="_blank">habitcalendar.co</a>. </p>

    <p>A graveyard of unrealised ambition is what my Namecheap account is.</p>

    <p>Except my friend suggested I install Copilot and let AI do the groundwork. Writing javascript is sometimes a slog for me, so I was willing to try.</p>

    <p>Me and Dan the Deer got started.</p>

    <p>Suddenly we were on a roll. The code was far from perfect, but it almost wrote itself. I had to summon my 15 years of dev experience a few times to implement the tricky parts, but by that time I was in the zone.</p>

    <p>By 7pm I felt that I was almost done and posted an Instagram story saying I was going to launch the project on ProductHunt the next day. Friends liked it and there was no going back now.</p>

    <h2>Time to Ship</h2>

    <p>Jan 1st came and it was time to ship. I marked the missing features as <i>coming soon</i> and submitted the project to 
        <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/2024-printable-habit-calendar" target="_blank">ProductHunt</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38831735" target="_blank">HackerNews</a>.</p>

    <p>It never made it to the Featured page on ProductHunt, despite having more upvotes than half of the featured projects at some point. But on Hacker News, it spent a solid 48 hours on the first page of the Show HN section, and some people loved it. A few of them found a Buy me a Coffee link at the bottom of the app and bought me 6 coffees.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I was a person who not only shipped a product, but also made money from her products, and it was only Jan 1st.</p>

    <h2>Time to Ship, Again</h2>
    
    <p>A few days later I got an email from GitHub marketplace saying my app, <a href="https://todoguard.dev/" target="_blank">todoguard.dev</a>, got approved. Right! The app I started coding at the tail end of the last year.</p>

    <p>I now knew what shipping fast looked like. I speedran through the final fixes for To-do Guard and added the link to my Twitter bio. While I was thinking how to launch it, the analytics showed 5 visits to the site and I got two free customers.</p>

    <p>Suddenly I was a person who shipped not one, but two projects, and had customers to support â€” and it was only Jan 9th.</p>

    <p>I was now one of those people who ship projects.</p>
